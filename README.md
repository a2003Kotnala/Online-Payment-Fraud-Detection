# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
This is my Data Science Project which i completed during my minor project. This project consists of: 
-> Python for transformation or cleaning of data 
-> Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for visualization of data 
-> Machine Learning for calculating the accuracy of the data

Basically i used:
-> My data was related to categorical values so it was a classification supervised problem.
-> So the alogrithms that i used: 
            -XGBoost Classifier
            -Logistic Regression 
            -Random Forest Classifier
-> I haven't done downsampling so you guys can go for it
